This is the **React (Vite)** frontend of the system.
It renders a dynamic table of machine objects, where the table fields are generated automatically based on the backend schema.

## What I Learned

* How to use **Object commands** in JavaScript/TypeScript to access variable names directly.
* Built a **dynamic table** that adapts to schema changes without rewriting the code.
* Strengthened my skills in building **flexible UI components** that react to server-side data in real time.
